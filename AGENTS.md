# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This repository builds `dress-rehearsal`, a Rust-based infrastructure
integration harness.

CLI name: `dress`

The goal is to make infrastructure changes rehearsable through full end-to-end
execution:
- isolated run context
- deploy/apply
- verification
- teardown/cleanup
- artifact preservation on failure

This project exists to make infrastructure change safe to verify, not merely
easy to declare.

## Core Engineering Principles

### 1. Abstract first

Do not grow this into a pile of scripts with hidden coupling.

When repeated orchestration patterns appear, extract explicit abstractions.
Prefer named boundaries over procedural sprawl.

### 2. TDD where practical

Use tests to lock down:
- abstraction boundaries
- failure semantics
- cleanup guarantees
- verification behavior

The architecture must support three levels of testing:
- unit tests for isolated logic and invariants
- mock tests that abstract the external environment seen by the executable
- integration tests that exercise a real minimal external environment and
  workflow

Not every tiny step requires tests first, but core execution model changes
should be driven by tests whenever practical.

### 3. Directory structure first

Keep clear separation of concerns in the codebase.

Avoid mixing:
- CLI parsing
- run context/state
- orchestration
- backend-specific logic
- scenario-specific logic
- verification logic
- cleanup logic

### 4. Explicit interfaces over convenience helpers

Prefer small, explicit traits and structs over loose helper functions.

This tool must remain evolvable under change.

Interfaces should be shaped so they can be exercised at all three testing
levels without hidden coupling.

### 5. No hidden state

Do not rely on:
- global mutable state
- ambient environment assumptions
- ad hoc temp paths
- implicit cross-step coupling

All meaningful execution state should flow through explicit context objects.

## Architecture Guardrails

### Stable core concepts

The architecture should preserve these concepts:

- `RunContext`
- `StepRunner`
- `CleanupManager`
- `DeploymentBackend`
- `Scenario`
- `VerificationSpec`

### Strict provider boundary

`dress-rehearsal` orchestrates Terraform/OpenTofu execution and generic
rehearsal mechanics only.

It must not:
- model provider services such as ECS, Lambda, Cloud Run, or similar
- encode service-specific lifecycle concepts in the CLI or core abstractions
- require provider-service identifiers or provider-service runtime commands
- perform provider-specific discovery that Terraform/OpenTofu should handle

If a `Scenario` abstraction remains, it is only a narrow, provider-agnostic
way to express generic prerequisites, backend inputs, and generic output or
artifact handling around Terraform/OpenTofu. It must not become a provider
service model.

### Plugin architecture, but narrow

This project supports pluggable internal abstractions for:

#### Deployment backends

Examples:
- Terraform/OpenTofu
- CloudFormation

Use internal Rust traits/modules.
Do not build dynamic plugin loading.
Do not build a framework.

### Scenario meaning

A `Scenario` is not just:
- a directory
- a list of scripts
- a shell pipeline

A `Scenario` is, at most, a provider-agnostic rehearsal contract around the
Terraform/OpenTofu run:
- prerequisite checks
- backend input shaping
- backend output discovery when needed

For the first version, a `Scenario` must remain narrow:
- prerequisite checks
- backend input shaping
- backend output discovery when needed

A `Scenario` must not:
- issue direct cloud-service lifecycle commands
- own service-specific deploy, scale, or drain behavior
- model provider services or service families
- perform application-level verification such as HTTP health checks

## Scope Discipline

Do not build:
- a YAML DSL
- a generic workflow engine
- a multi-cloud platform
- a plugin marketplace
- support for hypothetical future use cases before real demand
- cloud-service lifecycle orchestration outside `DeploymentBackend`
- provider-service-aware scenarios or service taxonomies
- application correctness checks into the first Terraform/OpenTofu path
- service-specific lifecycle contracts of any kind

Do build:
- a small, explicit infrastructure rehearsal engine
- one happy path at a time
- reusable boundaries proven by at least two real use cases before broadening
  them
- a lifecycle rehearsal focused on backend apply/destroy
- strong observability around apply failure, destroy failure, and preserved artifacts

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Extraction over rewrite

Prefer incremental extraction from working behavior.
Do not rewrite everything at once.

### 2. Move one happy path first

Stabilize one real path using the new abstractions before migrating additional
paths.

### 3. Cleanup is structural

Cleanup must be guaranteed by the execution model, not by convention or memory.

### 4. Preserve failure artifacts

When runs fail, preserve enough artifacts and summaries to support diagnosis.

### 5. Keep the core independent

Do not couple the architecture to devloop or other external orchestration
tools. Future integrations are fine, but the core must stand alone.

## Tooling Requirements

### beads

Use beads for planning and execution tracking.

When substantial work is needed:
- create or update epics/issues first
- keep issue scope explicit
- prefer small executable units

### roborev

Use roborev for adversarial review.

Especially use it to critique:
- abstraction quality
- coupling risks
- naming quality
- missing invariants
- cleanup/failure semantics

Do not treat roborev as ceremonial.
Use it to find real architectural weaknesses.

## Review Heuristics

Before merging a change, ask:

- Does this make boundaries clearer or blurrier?
- Does this reduce coupling or hide it?
- Does cleanup become more guaranteed or less?
- Does verification become more explicit or more procedural?
- Does this keep lifecycle control inside the deployment backend?
- Does this avoid coupling the tool to provider-service runtime commands?
- Does verification stay focused on lifecycle success/failure and diagnosability?
- Would a second backend or scenario fit without reshaping the core?
- Is this abstraction demanded by real behavior, or invented too early?
- Can this behavior be tested at unit, mock, and real integration levels
  without redesigning the boundary?

## First-Version Boundary

The first path is a Terraform/OpenTofu lifecycle rehearsal, not a provider
service test harness.

Allowed:
- Terraform/OpenTofu apply
- Terraform/OpenTofu destroy
- prerequisite checks
- output discovery needed to describe the run
- artifact and log preservation

Not allowed:
- direct provider service lifecycle commands
- runtime health checks, HTTP assertions, or readiness polling
- requiring provider-service identifiers for lifecycle control outside backend destroy

## Naming

- Repository / concept: `dress-rehearsal`
- CLI: `dress`

Keep the metaphor coherent:
this tool performs a full rehearsal before live execution.

## Current Bias

Bias toward:
- explicit state
- small interfaces
- strong cleanup semantics
- reproducibility
- readability
- evolvability

Bias against:
- cleverness
- hidden control flow
- ambient assumptions
- giant abstractions
- premature generalization

## Session Completion

When ending a work session in this repo:

1. File or update beads for remaining work.
2. Run the relevant quality gates for changed code.
3. Update issue status so the next session starts from the real state.
4. Sync and push completed work:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status
   ```
5. Confirm the branch is up to date and the work is not stranded locally.

Do not stop at a locally complete change if the repo workflow still expects the
work to be synced and pushed.

## Commit Commentary Requirements

Every non-trivial change MUST include a commit message that captures not only
what changed, but why.

Commit messages must include:

1. Context
   - What problem or ambiguity triggered this change?
   - What behavior or assumption was incorrect or unclear?

2. Decision
   - What change was made?
   - What boundary or invariant is now enforced?

3. Alternatives considered
   - At least one alternative approach that was considered
   - Why it was rejected

4. Tradeoffs
   - What is intentionally not supported after this change?
   - What risks or limitations are accepted?

5. Architectural impact
   - Which core concepts or boundaries are affected?
   - Does this reinforce or weaken any guardrails?

Example structure:
